EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
{'='*80}

This report presents a complete path planning solution for the Posha autonomous 
cooking robot. The implementation includes both macro and micro dispensing 
operations with advanced collision avoidance, motion planning optimization, 
and comprehensive testing.

1. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
{'='*80}

1.1 Workspace Configuration:
   - Macro Containers: 5 containers (A-E) with precise coordinates
   - Spice Pods: 20 pods in circular arrangement on spice rack
   - Cooking Pans: 2 pans (Pan 1 & Pan 2) with defined positions
   - Robot Workspace: 1.2m x 0.8m x 0.6m operational volume

1.2 Coordinate Frames:
   - World Frame: Fixed reference at robot base
   - Robot Base Frame: Arm mounting point
   - End Effector Frame: Gripper contact point
   - Container/Pod Frames: Individual storage locations
   - Pan Frames: Separate frames for each pan

1.3 Transformation Matrices:
   T_World_Base = [1 0 0 x_base; 0 1 0 y_base; 0 0 1 z_base; 0 0 0 1]
   T_Base_EE = f(θ₁, θ₂, θ₃, θ₄, θ₅, θ₆)  # Forward kinematics

2. PATH PLANNING ALGORITHMS
{'='*80}

2.1 Macro Dispense Algorithm:
   - Input: Container ID, Pan ID
   - Output: Optimized trajectory with waypoints
   - Steps:
     1. Approach container (100mm above)
     2. Gripper engagement (5mm above container lip)
     3. Lift to safe clearance height
     4. RRT-based transit path to pan
     5. Dispense sequence over pan
     6. Return to storage position

2.2 Micro Dispense Algorithm:
   - Input: Pod ID, Pan ID  
   - Output: High-precision trajectory
   - Steps:
     1. High-precision approach (2mm from pod surface)
     2. Obstacle-aware transit path
     3. Precision dispense sequence
     4. Return to rack position

2.3 RRT Implementation:
   - Sampling-based planning in 3D workspace
   - Collision checking with cylindrical and box obstacles
   - Path optimization for smoothness
   - Maximum iterations: 1000 nodes
   - Step size: 0.05m resolution

3. COLLISION DETECTION & AVOIDANCE
{'='*80}

3.1 Collision Detection Methods:
   - Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) for efficient checking
   - Continuous collision detection along path segments
   - Point-in-obstacle testing for sampled waypoints

3.2 Obstacle Definition:
   - Cylindrical obstacles: Center column (r=0.15m, h=0.3m)
   - Box obstacles: Equipment boxes (0.1m x 0.1m x 0.3m)
   - Safety margin: 50mm around all obstacles

3.3 Avoidance Strategies:
   - Alternative path generation via RRT
   - Waypoint optimization around obstacles
   - Vertical clearance maneuvers
   - Trajectory scaling and reshaping

4.1 Optimization Criteria:
   - Time Efficiency: Minimize total path length
   - Energy Consumption: Smooth acceleration profiles
   - Safety: Maintain safe distances from obstacles
   - Stability: Avoid rapid direction changes

4.2 Trajectory Generation:
   - Cubic spline interpolation between waypoints
   - Velocity constraints: max 0.5 m/s
   - Acceleration constraints: max 2.0 m/s²
   - Jerk constraints: max 5.0 m/s³
